I've recently started doing the [Modern Binary Exploitation](https://github.com/RPISEC/MBE/) challenges, and figured i'd do writeups on them to consolidate my learning as I went.

### Start
Marking crackme0x02 as executable with `chmod +x crackme0x02` and running it provides with with a prompt to enter a password:

### Ghidra
Opening this up in Ghidra, we can open up the function list on the left menu

And we can see that it contains the main function if we scroll down:

This program has not been stripped of it's debug symbols, so we can still see function names thankfully. Inside of the main function we have this:

Taking a look at our decompiled main, it looks like if the password we enter is equal to `0x52b24` we have found the correct password.

 This is a hexadecimal number, so lets convert it to binary and give it a try!

Great, so this works but how does the assembly code work? I decided to try tracing the assembly code and this is what I came up with:

Below is the original ASM code, then my interpretation of the code
```nasm
MOV        dword ptr [EBP + local_c],   0x5a00
MOV        dword ptr [EBP + local_10],  0x1ec00
MOV        EDX,                         dword ptr [EBP + local_10]
LEA        EAX+local_c,                 [EBP + -0x8]
ADD        dword ptr [EAX]+local_c,     EDX
MOV        EAX+local_c,                 dword ptr [EBP + -0x8]
IMUL       EAX,                         dword ptr [EBP + local_c]
MOV        dword ptr [EBP + local_10],  EAX
MOV        EAX,                         dword ptr [EBP + local_8]
CMP        EAX,                         dword ptr [EBP + local_10]
```

```
mov [EBP + local_c], 0x5a
local_c = 0x5a
local_c = 90

mov [EBP + local_10], 0x1ec
local_10 = 0x1ec
local_10 = 492

mov EDX, [EBP + local_10]
EDX = local_10
EDX = 492

lea EAX+local_c, [EBP + -0x8]
EAX = *local_c
EAX = 90

add [EAX]+local_c, EDX
local_c = local_c + EDX
local_c = 90 + 492
local_c = 582

mov EAX+local_c, [EBP + -0x8]
EAX = local_c
EAX = 582

imul EAX, [EBP + local_c]
EAX = EAX * (EBP + local_c)
EAX = 582 * 582

mov dword ptr [EBP + local_10],EAX
local_10 = EAX
local_10 = 338724

mov EAX,dword ptr [EBP + local_8]
EAX = local_8

cmp EAX,dword ptr [EBP + local_10]
EAX == local_10
input == 338724
```


### Conclusion
After doing both static analysis with Ghidra and a stack trace of the assembly code, we can see that the password 338724 works, and we have successfully cracked this program!
